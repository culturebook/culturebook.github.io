    <h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
    <p>Culturebook provides the platform to view, curate and promote our cultural heritage.</p>
    <h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission  is to develop a complete web-based platform where users can browse, engage and interact with our cultural heritage from paintings and exhibits to user contributions such as audio narrative, podcasts, video and multi-lingual translations.</p>
    <p>Culturebook is all about engaging with cultural heritage in an engaging and exciting way any place, anywhere. This is more than just another museum tour guide: it's an access-anywhere portal for cultural heritage and interrelated package-based trips.</p>
    <p>Communities help define and keep alive a culture: that is why we strongly believe in making Culturebook a platform for people to present and share with us their culture. We will look to support and promote events far and wide which tie in with specific cultural occasions.</p>
    <p>Inclusivity will be at the core of making Culturebook a platform design for all. We want to make cultural heritage accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities and help open up opportunities to explore museums artifacts and tangible culture physically as well as virtually.</p>
    <p>Looking into the longer term Culturebook Store will be an extensive online retail experience offering users the opportunity to buy gifts and souvenirs from partnering museums as well as vacation packages which enable users to plan an entire trip or vacation round specific cultural locations.</p>
